    <h1>CASE STUDY FOR MEET APP</h1>
    <img src="img/case study/Meet/Meet1.png">

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="Overview">
        <p>Meet App was a personal project I built as part of my Full-Stack Web Development course at CareerFoundary. This Meet App goal was to create an event site where users can easily view events. Build a lightweight event management platform by integrating Google Calendar API with a serverless (FaaS) backend.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Implementation Process</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <h3>Define Requirements and Features</h3>
        <ul>
           <li> Show a list of events</li>
           <li>Manage how many events are displayed</li>
            <li>View detailed information about each event</li>
                <li>Search for events by city</li>
                    <li>Choose number of events to display</li>
                        <li>Event Visualization:</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h2> Data Visualization</h2>
<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li>  Chart 1: Number of Events by Genre
        </li>  →This chart displays how many events are available across different genres, helping users explore based on their interests.
        <li> Chart 2: Number of Events by City
        </li> →This chart shows the number of events per city, allowing users to discover the most active cities for events. These visualizations make it easy for users to see overall trends at a glance and personalize their event discovery experience.
    </ul>
</div>  

    <h2>Achievements & Lessons Learned</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a full-stack, serverless event discovery platform</li>
    → Built both frontend and backend independently, using AWS Lambda and React.

    <li>Integrated real-time data from Google Calendar API</li>
    → Successfully fetched, displayed, and managed live event data.

    <li>Implemented Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities</li>
    → Enabled offline access and installable app experience using service workers.

    <li>Built interactive data visualizations</li>
    → Created dynamic charts that allow users to quickly understand event trends by city and genre.

    <li>Achieved 90%+ test coverage</li>
        → Used Jest and Cucumber to ensure high reliability through rigorous testing.

    li>Mastered OAuth2 Authentication Flow</li>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>  Serverless architecture simplifies deployment and scaling but requires careful management of cold starts and token handling.</li>
            <li>Working with third-party APIs like Google Calendar requires robust error handling and quota management.</li>
            <li> Visualizing data through charts significantly enhances user engagement and provides deeper insights.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
